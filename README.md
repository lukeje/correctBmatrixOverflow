# Scripts to correct for *B*-matrix overflow
Matlab scripts to read *b*-values and *b*-vectors from Siemens raw data (twix) files and DICOMs which work even for very large *b*-values.

The scripts account for an integer overflow situation that can occur when *b*-values of more than about 16,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> are used.
This is not usually achievable with Siemens product diffusion sequences as they seem to be limited to a maximum *b*-value of 10,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>.
However some user sequences (especially those installed on Connectom scanners) override this limitation in order to make best use of the possibilities of the scanner.
*b*-values above about 49,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> will still have problems with integer overflow which these scripts will not be able to correct for.

For *b*-values from around 16,000 to 30,000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> the main effect of this bug seems to be just a flip of the polarity of the affected vectors.
This means that diffusion metrics are largely unaffected because conventional diffusion encoding does not encode polarity.
However using the corrected vectors should improve eddy-current correction (using e.g. [eddy](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy)) and thus improve data quality.

## Usage
### Read from folder containing DICOM files
```matlab
readBvecsFromDicom('input_dicom_folder/', 'output_folder/', 'output_name');
```
will read in all the DICOM files in the input folder `input_dicom_folder` and write out the *b*-vectors and *b*-values to `output_folder/output_name.bvec` and `output_folder/output_name.bval`, respectively.
It will also output the nominal *b*-values to `output_folder/output_name_nominal.bval`.

Notes:
- The input folder must only contain DICOM files. 
- The DICOM files in the input folder must correspond to only one acquisition, otherwise the *b*-vectors and *b*-values from multiple acquisitions would be concatenated.
- If there are multiple files per volume (e.g. because the mosaic output option was not used on the scanner) then there will be one *b*-vector and *b*-value per image (slice) rather than per volume in the output files.
- Acquisition order is not (currently) checked; it is assumed that this matches the order of the files returned by running [`dir`](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dir.html) on the input folder.
- The Siemens CSA DICOM fields `B_value`, `B_matrix`, and `DiffusionGradientDirection` must be present in the DICOM files.
- Due to differences in the definition of NIfTI and DICOM image spaces, the polarity of the output vectors may need to be flipped to use them to process NIfTI-converted data. This should be carefully checked by the user, e.g. by using [`dwigradcheck`](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/commands/dwigradcheck.html) from [MRtrix3](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or through [visual inspection of the output vector orientations from a DTI fit](http://camino.cs.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?n=Tutorials.DTI#dt_fit).

Optionally a 3Ã—3 transformation matrix may be supplied which will rotate/flip the *b*-vectors before saving them.
As an example, the following code would flip the second component of the *b*-vectors:
```matlab
T = diag([1,-1,1]);
readBvecsFromDicom('input_dicom_folder/', 'output_folder/', 'output_name', T);
```
A convenience function `transformForNifti` is provided which takes a NIfTI file as input, and outputs a transformation matrix which takes the *b*-vectors from scanner space to NIfTI image space.
It is assumed that the NIfTI file is from the same acquisition as the b-vectors and that the transform in the NIfTI file is the transform from scanner space to image space (i.e. no re-alignment has been performed).

### Read from twix file
```matlab
readBvecsFromTwix('input_twix_folder/input_twix_file.dat', 'output_folder/');
```
will read in the twix file `input_twix_folder/input_twix_file.dat` and write out the *b*-vectors and *b*-values of the last acquired line in each repetition to `output_folder/input_twix_file.bvec` and `output_folder/input_twix_file.bval`, respectively.
It will also output the nominal *b*-values to `output_folder/input_twix_file_nominal.bval`.

You can alternatively provide an already generated twix object, for example:
```matlab
twixobj = mapVBVD('input_twix_folder/input_twix_file.dat');
readBvecsFromTwix(twixobj, 'output_folder/');
```
which will do the same as the first example.
This can be useful to avoid having to repeat reading in the twix object if it is already being used elsewhere in a script.

Notes:
- [mapVBVD](https://github.com/pehses/mapVBVD) is used to read the twix file (see [Dependencies](#dependencies) below).
- This script assumes that different diffusion encodings are indexed by the "repetition" index.
- A transformation matrix may be supplied in the same way as in the DICOM example.

### Read from MRD file
```matlab
readBvecsFromMrd('input_mrd_folder/input_mrd_file.h5', 'output_folder/');
```
will read in the MRD file `input_mrd_folder/input_mrd_file.h5` and write out the *b*-vectors and *b*-values of the last acquired line in each repetition to `output_folder/input_mrd_file.bvec` and `output_folder/input_mrd_file.bval`, respectively.
It will also output the nominal *b*-values to `output_folder/input_mrd_file_nominal.bval`.

You can alternatively provide an already generated MRD object, for example:
```matlab
mrd = ismrmrd.Dataset('input_mrd_folder/input_mrd_file.h5', 'dataset');
readBvecsFromMrd(mrd, 'output_folder/');
```
which will do the same as the first example.
This can be useful to avoid having to repeat reading in the MRD file if it is already being used elsewhere in a script.

Notes:
- The Matlab implementation of MRD from the [ISMRMRD repository](https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd) is used to read the file.
- This script assumes that different diffusion encodings are indexed by the "repetition" index.
- A transformation matrix may be supplied in the same way as in the DICOM example.

## Installation
### Using git
First navigate to an appropriate directory and then run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukeje/correctBmatrixOverflow
```
The folder `correctBmatrixOverflow` should then be added to your [Matlab path](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html).

If you want to read in *b*-vectors and -values from twix files or MRD files, then you will also need to install [mapVBVD](https://github.com/pehses/mapVBVD) or [ISMRMRD](https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd), respectively.
For convenience, these have been added as git submodules which can be installed by running
```sh
cd correctBmatrixOverflow
git submodule update --init
```
after cloning the `correctBmatrixOverflow` repository.
You will then need to additionally add the subfolder `mapVBVD` or `ismrmd/matlab` to your Matlab path.

### As a zip file
The code can be downloaded as a [zip file](https://github.com/lukeje/correctBmatrixOverflow/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
After unzipping the code to an appropriate directory, the folder `correctBmatrixOverflow-main` should then be added to your [Matlab path](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html).

If you want to read in *b*-vectors and -values from twix or MRD files, then you will need to manually install [mapVBVD](https://github.com/pehses/mapVBVD) or [ISMRMRD](https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd) and add the appropriate folders to your Matlab path.

## Dependencies
`readBvecsFromDicom` requires the Matlab [image processing toolbox](https://mathworks.com/help/images/index.html).

`readBvecsFromTwix` requires [mapVBVD](https://github.com/pehses/mapVBVD) to be on the [Matlab path](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html) in order to read *b*-vectors and -values from Siemens twix files.

`readBvecsFromMrd` requires the `matlab` folder from the [ISMRMRD repository](https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd) to be on the [Matlab path](https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html) in order to read *b*-vectors and -values from MRD files derived from Siemens diffusion sequences.

## Current status
- These scripts have only been tested on data from a Siemens Connectom scanner with software version VD11, where they were found to be able to correct the *b*-vectors measured at a *b*-value of 30,450 s/mm<sup>2</sup>.
- Different software versions and sequences may differ in the information contained in the twix, MRD and DICOM headers, and therefore not work.
- The diffusion vector information is only likely to be present in the expected part of the header if "free" mode is used for the diffusion vectors.
- It is the responsibility of the user to check that the results of using these scripts are sensible.
